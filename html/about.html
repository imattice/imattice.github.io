<h2 class='title'>So... Who the Heck is Ike?</h2>

<p class='about_me'>
    I am a Level 4 Technomancer who enjoys employing machines to do my bidding using Internet magicz.
    I love the feeling of furiously typing away at the keyboard and coming away with something that is fun to use and way-super-cool.  While I am still pretty noob at programming, I'm no stranger to learning new things quickly and breaking down complex problems.  My favorite flavors of programming include front end development with HTML, CSS and Sass, and vanilla Javascript, game development with Unity, and making iOS apps in Xcode.

<p class='about_me'>Oh!  I'm also pretty nerdy - I love all things fantasy and video games.  I can make a mean cake (like, you should probably anticipate baked goods coming your way if we meet in person). Puppies are great too.</p>
