<h2 class='title'>Ike!</h2>

<p class='about_me'>
    Internet architect.  Websmith.  Technomancer.

    I can't seem to settle on what I want my title to be, but I do know that I love building Internets.  I love the feeling of furiously typing away at the keyboard and coming away with something that is fun to use and way-super-cool.  While I am still pretty noob at programming, I'm no stranger to learning new things quickly and breaking down complex problems.  I'm looking forward to spending some time developing games and other websites in the near future!

<p class='about_me'>Oh!  I'm also pretty nerdy - I love all things fantasy and video games.  I can make a mean cake (like, awesome-mean, not angry-mean.). Puppies are great too.</p>
